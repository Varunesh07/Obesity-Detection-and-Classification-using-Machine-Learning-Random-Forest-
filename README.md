# Obesity Classification using Random Forest

This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to classify individuals into obesity categories based on their physical and lifestyle attributes.  
It includes complete **data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation** using Python and Scikit-learn.

##  Features
- Data loading and cleaning from `Obesity Classification.csv`
- Outlier detection with boxplots and IQR method
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Classification using `RandomForestClassifier`
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

##  Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (train_test_split, StandardScaler, RandomForestClassifier)

##  Results
- Achieved high accuracy on test data using Random Forest
- Provides detailed model metrics and visual insights

##  How to Run
